Runeriot_DESCRIPTION,"Disillusionment and dissatisfaction with its society can lead a Savvas to break its own core and journey to the world's frontiers, bringing along the elemental education it received before striking out on its own. Once it chooses where to make a place for itself, it puts all of its efforts into scuplting a community where it is respected and empowered, often clashing with whatever systems have already been established there. As natural leaders, these Runeriots will garner support to put pressure on societies that they see as imperfect and able to be changed, unlike the one they chose to leave behind. And if those societies try to use force to quiet a Runeriot, it will be ready to defend what it believes."
